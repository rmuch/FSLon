FSLon - Implementation of Lua Object Notation in F#
===================================================

Introduction
------------

This is a small project to create a parser for Lua Object Notation for the
.NET Framework. It's written in F# and uses the excellent FParsec library.

The first iteration of this parser was written in an evening, demonstrating
how easy it is to use FParsec to create robust parsers.

Refer to the C implementation, liblon, for more information.
